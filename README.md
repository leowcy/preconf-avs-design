# Preconfirmation AVS Design

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
Design an Active Validator Service(AVS) on EigenLayer that provides credible preconfirmations for Eth transactions.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- System Architecture
- Economic Model Thinkings
- Security Analysis
- Implementation Considerations

---

## ðŸ’¡ Basic Understanding for Users + L1 + AVS

- Below is the understanding of Users/L1 network/AVS+EigenLayer(L2) relationship diagram.

## ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution
Explain the proposed solution in detail:
- **Description**: Describe the solution and how it solves the problem.
- **Methodology**: Outline the approach or technologies involved.
- **Deliverables**: List what will be delivered (e.g., code, documentation, designs).

---

## ðŸ“Š Benefits
Highlight the benefits of implementing this proposal:
- How does it improve or solve the problem?
- What value does it add (e.g., cost-saving, efficiency, usability)?

---

## ðŸ›  Implementation Plan
Provide an actionable plan for implementation:
1. **Phase 1**: Define the initial setup or research phase.
2. **Phase 2**: Outline development or production steps.
3. **Phase 3**: Describe testing and deployment.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Resources Required
List the resources needed:
- Tools or software
- Personnel
- Budget (if applicable)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk 1**: Consecutive validators could potentially collude to break preconfirmation promises. How
might you prevent this?  
  **Mitigation**: Plan to address it

- **Risk 2**: What happens if a block containing preconfirmed transactions gets reorged?
  **Mitigation**: Plan to address it
