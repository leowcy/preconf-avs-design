## ðŸ’¡ System Architecture
Explain the proposed solution in detail:
- **Description**: Describe the solution and how it solves the problem.
- **Methodology**: Outline the approach or technologies involved.
- **Deliverables**: List what will be delivered (e.g., code, documentation, designs).

## ðŸ’¡ Economic Model
Explain the proposed solution in detail:
- **Description**: Describe the solution and how it solves the problem.
- **Methodology**: Outline the approach or technologies involved.
- **Deliverables**: List what will be delivered (e.g., code, documentation, designs).

## ðŸ’¡ Security Analysis
Explain the proposed solution in detail:
- **Description**: Describe the solution and how it solves the problem.
- **Methodology**: Outline the approach or technologies involved.
- **Deliverables**: List what will be delivered (e.g., code, documentation, designs).

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Considerations
Provide an actionable plan for implementation:
1. **Phase 1**: Define the initial setup or research phase.
2. **Phase 2**: Outline development or production steps.
3. **Phase 3**: Describe testing and deployment.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk 1**: Consecutive validators could potentially collude to break preconfirmation promises. How
might you prevent this?  
  **Mitigation**: Plan to address it

- **Risk 2**: What happens if a block containing preconfirmed transactions gets reorged?
  **Mitigation**: Plan to address it
